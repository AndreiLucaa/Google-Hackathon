## AgriTech 🌱📱⌚

AgriTech is an innovative Android and WearOS application designed during the Google Hackathon to help users monitor the health of their gardens in real time.

Using environmental data collected by a Sparrow device — including temperature, pressure, air quality, and luminosity — AgriTech analyzes conditions and instantly reports if the garden state is good or bad.
